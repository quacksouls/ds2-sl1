# Crown of the Ivory King

The Crown of the Ivory King doesn't boost your stats, but it restores your HP at
a rate of 2 HP every 3 seconds.

## Frozen Eleum Loyce

Collect the Garrison Ward Key, which opens the door to the Expulsion Chamber
bonfire. The nearby stone coffin transports you to the Frigid Outskirt, the
gauntlet area of the DLC. There are no notable loots at the Frigid Outskirt and
defeating the gank boss there wouldn't yield anything useful (apart from the
boss souls). It's OK to skip the Frigid Outskirt. Next, rescue Loyce Knight x 3,
who will help you during the fight against the Burnt Ivory King. Collect the
Ring of Resistance+1, useful for boosting your petrify defense by 200 points.
Equip the ring when dashing through areas where enemies can build up your
petrify metre. Locate a room that holds five iron chests, one of which is a
Mimic. One of the chests contains a Titanite Slab and another chest contains
Brightbug x 2.

## Burnt Ivory King

{% youtube id="v9TLFSd6T2E", title="SL1 Burnt Ivory King, Dark Souls 2: SotFS" %}{% endyoutube %}

This boss is weak against lightning. Buff your Raw Ice Rapier+10 with Gold Pine
Resin. The Ice Rapier is recommended for two reasons. First, unlike the Rapier,
the Ice Rapier can build up the bleed bar of the Burnt Ivory King, or any enemy
that is vulnerable to bleed. Second, the Ice Rapier has a faster attack
animation than the Mace or Homunculus Mace. You will have many opportunities to
output two hits with the Ice Rapier. However, note that the Raw Rapier+10 deals
more damage than the Raw Ice Rapier+10 and it's very likely that you will never
bleed the boss at all during the whole fight.

Defeat the Burnt Ivory King and collect the Crown of the Ivory King.
