# Introduction

This guide helps you to progress in your first SL1 run of Dark Souls II: SotFS.
You will be shown how to become as powerful as possible while remaining at soul
level 1. Below are some general tips to bear in mind during your first SL1
playthrough.

1. Stats boosting gears are essential, especially equipment that boosts your
   Adaptability. Unlike other games in the Dark Souls series, in Dark Souls 2
   SotFS your i-frame is tied to your Adaptability. The higher is your
   Adaptability, the more i-frames you would have. Having at least 14
   Adaptability should allow you to roll through most attacks. However, it's
   safer to be outside the hit box of an attack rather than rolling through an
   attack. Whenever possible, you should bait an attack, be outside the range of
   the attack, and go in for the punish.
1. Always fight one enemy at a time and avoid being ganked. In a gank situation,
   try to separate the enemies or bait (or wait for) the enemies to attack at
   the same time. Snipe an enemy whenever possible, pick your battle, and choose
   the terrain for combat.
1. Although it might sound like a good idea to run past enemies, this is a
   suicidal plan. Dying means you must start again from the last bonfire you
   rested at. It's safer to clear your path whenever possible. Summon NPCs to
   distract enemies while you make your way to your destination.
1. The Short Bow and Light Crossbow are useful for clearing the paths to certain
   destinations. Poison Arrows are especially effective against many powerful
   enemies. The Avelyn is recommended for dealing chip damage and to safely
   dispatch of various enemies.
1. Maces and rapiers are among some of the most powerful weapons you can wield.
   Maces are effective at dealing poise damage to enemies, causing enemies to
   stagger so you would be able to get in an extra hit. The two-handed R1 of a
   mace might seem rather slow, but the rolling R1 has a faster attack
   animation. The glaring disadvantage of a mace is that you must be rather
   close to an enemy for your hit to connect. In some cases, you might find a
   rapier to be effective at dealing with some enemies. The two-handed R1 of a
   rapier has a faster attack and recovery animation than that of a mace.
   Furthermore, a rapier has longer reach than a mace, allowing you to hit an
   enemy from some distance away.
1. Despite being SL1, you can still two-hand various large weapons such as great
   hammers and ultra great swords. With the right gears equipped, you can
   two-hand the Great Club, the Old Knight Hammer, and the Greatsword. Once you
   can properly two-hand the Greatsword, many enemies can easily be cleared
   without using bow and arrows (or crossbow and bolts).
1. Learn to backup your save file at various points in your playthrough. For
   example, when you are in front of the fog wall of a boss arena, quit to menu
   and backup your save file. Dying to a boss doesn't mean you must run to the
   fog wall again. Simply reload your backup.
1. Learn from your mistakes. Study how no-hit runners approach a particular
   situation and incorporate their strategies into your game play. You might
   find these useful.<br/>

1. Infuse multiple copies of a weapon with different elemental stones. Farm
   elemental stones from the nest of Basilisks at Things Betwixt. Some of the
   useful elemental stones include Boltstone, Faintstone, Firedrake Stone, and
   Darknight Stone. By way of example, purchase Mace x 4 and infuse each copy
   with a different elemental stone. Some bosses are weak against a particular
   element. Use a weapon that has been infused with the corresponding elemental
   stone to fight a boss. Concentrate on the fight instead of being distracted
   by the thought of looking for opportunities to buff your weapon.
1. You won't be able to purchase an unlimited amount of a particular upgrade
   material until some time later in the game. Invest some time into farming for
   the upgrade material to upgrade your weapon(s) as high as possible at a
   particular point in your playthrough. Farming enemies also contribute to your
   Soul Memory. In NG+0, having at least one million Soul Memory would allow you
   to open the Shrine of Winter without first defeating the four Old Ones.
